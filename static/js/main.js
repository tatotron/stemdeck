// ─── Stem choice toggles on the import page ───
//
// Filter-chip semantics (Spotify-style). The natural mental model when
// a user sees all 6 stems lit up is "everything is extracted"; when
// they then click ONE chip, they expect "now only this one". A plain
// toggle inverts the clicked chip and leaves the others on, which
// reads as "I just deselected the one I wanted" -- exactly the user
// confusion that prompted this fix.
//
// Algorithm:
//  - "All selected" is the implicit default (no filter applied).
//  - First click on a chip while in default state switches to
//    "only this stem" (clears all others).
//  - Subsequent clicks on inactive chips ADD them to the filter.
//  - Clicks on the only-selected chip clear it; if that empties the
//    selection, we revert to "all selected" (wraparound).
//
// Persisted across reloads so the next song honors the user's last
// chosen subset, but a 0-selection state is normalized to all 6.
//
// What the row looks like at any moment lives in stemChoice.js, so the chips,
// the All button and the toggle below cannot disagree about it. Only the
// rules above are here.

// ─── Vocals: Combined / Lead + Backing toggle (on-demand split, #275) ───
//
// Two buttons, three states, and either of them can switch the vocals on.
//
// Vocals is the one stem with something to say about how it comes out, so the
// pair carries a state the other chips do not have: as one track, split into
// lead and backing, or not extracted at all. Neither button lit is that third
// state, and the chip beside them agrees with it. Pressing the mode already in
// force switches vocals off; pressing the other switches mode and leaves them
// on; pressing either from cold switches them on in that mode.
//
// The chip is a way in as well, and the shorter one: it switches vocals on as
// Combined without a second press. The modes were hidden, and later dimmed,
// until that chip had been pressed, which made saying how you want the vocals
// split something you could only do after asking for them.
//
// Which of the two is lit is decided in refreshStemChoiceVisuals, along with
// the chips. Painting from here as well is what put the All button a state
// behind its own chips once already (#658): two painters for one fact, and the
// one reachable by a click is never the one that is wrong.
